# What-Happens-When-Web3-Edition
An attempt to answer the age old interview question "What happens when you initiate a crypto transaction from your browser?"

This repo is inspired by Alex Gaynor's great [What Happens When](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) repo that attempts to describe the lifecycle of a web request in as much detail as possible. Some of the sections here will be identical but I intend to fill in some gaps around what happens on the server side and the potential security concerns and exploits that could occur at each step.

This is a collaborative process, so dig in and try to help out! There are tons of details missing, just waiting for you to add them! So send us a pull request, please!
